# web-projects

Various projects done using html-css-javascript ranging from replicating popular buttons (such as the youtube "subscribe" or twitter "tweet" button)
to a fully functioning ambient calculator all the way to a global weather tracker that uses an API to provide weather information of any desired city.
Creating these basic projects really furthered my interest in programming as well as strengthened my html, css, and javascript knowledge.
